**80's Alien Game**

This project was my first assignment in the Coding Academy course, where we were tasked with building a classic 80's alien invasion game using only vanilla JavaScript and basic CSS. 
At this stage, we had just learned the fundamentals of JavaScript and CSS, and no external libraries or frameworks were allowed. 
The goal was to implement game logic and interactivity purely through JavaScript, making it a rewarding challenge and a great learning experience in understanding core programming concepts.
